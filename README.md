# Home-Automation-System-Using-Arduino-Uno
In this project, we will design a simple Arduino Bluetooth Control Home Automation using the HC-05 Bluetooth module, which is used to switch ON or OFF different electrical appliances remotely. Home Automation systems can make our life easy and secure. Here we will control 4 different home appliances using Smartphone App through Bluetooth communication
